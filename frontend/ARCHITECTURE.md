# OCKRIX Frontend Architecture

## Product Philosophy

### Avatar & AI Presenter Exclusion Policy

**Avatars and AI presenters are intentionally excluded from early-stage OCKRIX for trust and performance reasons.**

OCKRIX prioritizes:
- **Trust**: Bank-grade, serious, professional interface
- **Speed**: Fast load times and smooth user experience
- **Security**: Focus on security features over visual gimmicks

#### Excluded Features
- ❌ Synthesia avatars
- ❌ AI presenters or talking heads
- ❌ Avatar video uploads
- ❌ Face/recording uploads
- ❌ Explainer videos with human presenters inside the app

#### Design Direction
- ✅ Static hero sections with abstract backgrounds
- ✅ Subtle gradients and icons
- ✅ Short, security-focused copy
- ✅ IdentityIQ-style clean fintech interface
- ✅ Trust-first, bank-grade appearance

#### Video Content
- Background videos: Abstract, non-human visuals only (if any)
- Marketing videos: External to the app (marketing site only)
- No in-app video uploads or avatar generation
