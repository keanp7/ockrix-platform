/**
 * Example Service File
 * 
 * Responsibility: Contains business logic and data manipulation.
 * Services are reusable and can be called by controllers or other services.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Implement business rules and logic
 * - Interact with databases or external APIs
 * - Transform and process data
 * - Handle complex operations and transactions
 * - Be database-agnostic (abstract data access)
 * 
 * Example structure:
 * 
 * const { NotFoundError } = require('../middleware/errorHandler');
 * 
 * exports.getExampleData = async (id) => {
 *   // Business logic here
 *   // Database queries
 *   // Data transformation
 *   return processedData;
 * };
 * 
 * exports.createExample = async (data) => {
 *   // Validation
 *   // Business rules
 *   // Save to database
 *   return savedData;
 * };
 */

// This is an example file showing the structure
// Replace with your actual service files
